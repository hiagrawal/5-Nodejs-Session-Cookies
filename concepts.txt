we want to persist the login data and login info across multiple requests so how can be do that...

req object persists only till we dont send the response. Once we send the res that req is lost
so if have to store loggedIn info, and we keep it in req object like we kept for user. req.user
we will not be able to access the same in another route when we send the response back

Another is we can save in a global variable and not in req object but if we do so, that would be shared across browers

so the way to handle this is, we save the data in user's browser

we can do so by setting cookie in response's header so it will saved in the user's browser 
and on every subsequent call made to the server, we get cookie paramter in request's body

we can check the same in developer's tool -> Application tab -> Cookie section -> and clicking on website name (localhost)

and can check the same in network tab in request header
